## Inset Shadows on Horizontal Scrolling elements

It was reported in November 2016 that mobile overtook desktops in terms of web visits. As viewports shrink, designers are tasked with the challenge of fitting all of the same information their desktop site holds onto mobile devices while staying usable.

In the past I've created designs which feature horizontally scrollable elements. These elements include:

- Links inside header navigation
- Related products in an ecommerce product page
- Tables with a lot of columns
