I was looking through Reddit and Github to try and find inspiration for things to code when I stumbled upon [this list of things to program](https://github.com/karan/Projects). The Caesar Cipher stood out to me, as it seemed like a fun way to practice manipulating content with javascript.

### Caesar Ciphers

If you haven't heard of a Caesar Cipher, don't worry; I had no clue what it was until I found this page. Basically, you provide a key (1-25) which represents how many characters in the alphabet to shift each letter in the message.

> For example, *HELLO* with a key of 4 would be encoded as *LIPPS*

Below is my take on encoding and decoding a Caesar Cipher. It turned out to be a fun little project manipulating input, comparing arrays, handling case sensitivity, and putting it all back together.
